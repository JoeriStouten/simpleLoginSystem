# simpleLoginSystem

I've created a simple login system using Python and tkinter as a gui. You are first able to register a user by creating an account with a username and a password. 

Features:

- Create an account by choosing a username and a password in the left side of the app.
- The username and password are stored apart from eachother in two lists.
- The username is displayed on screen, so the viewer knows which accounts are registered.
- Login on the right side of the app.
- The app checks wether the user fills in an existing username and password and then checks if the password belongs to the correct username.
- If done correctly, the app shows you have logged in, otherwise it shows you have failed to log in.


Optional Future changes:
- Store the usernames+passwords in excel
- Store the usernames+passwords in a database
- Set requirements for the passwords
- Set requirements for the usernames
- Do not allow double usernames
